\title{Human-Agent Collaboration for Real-World Disaster Response}
\author{Tracking No. XXX}

 \maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\begin{quote}
The allocation of emergency responders to rescue tasks is a key application area for agent-based coordination algorithms. However, to date, none of the proposed approaches take into account the inherent uncertainty  in disaster scenarios and, crucially, none have been field-trialled in order to understand how humans perform when instructed by an agent. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel representation and an algorithm, using Multi-agent Markov Decision Processes, to solve the problem of  coordinating emergency responders in uncertain environments. Moreover,  we deploy our algorithm in a mixed-reality game called AtomicOrchid, with an agent that works alongside a human commander to guide human players to complete rescue tasks. In our  trials, our algorithm is shown to improve  performance significantly (compared to a no-agent setting) and our results allow us to elucidate some of the key challenges faced when developing systems involving human-agent collaboration.
