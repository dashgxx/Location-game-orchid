\title{Human-Agent Collaboration for Disaster Response}

% AUTHORS


% For initial submission, do not give author names, but the
% tracking number, instead, as the review process is blind.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

%\numberofauthors{8} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%

% \author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
In the aftermath of major disasters, first responders are typically overwhelmed with large number of, spatially distributed, search and rescue tasks, each with its own requirements. Moreover, they have to operate in highly uncertain and dynamic environments where new tasks may appear and hazards may be spreading across the disaster space. Hence, rescue missions may need to be re-planned as new information comes in, tasks are completed, or new hazards are discovered. Hence, finding an optimal allocation of resources to complete all the tasks is a major computational challenge. Indeed,  a number of agent-based solutions have been developed to help human commanders perform such planning tasks. However, studies have shown that, unless these solutions minimise the cognitive burden imposed on human commanders and first responders, they may hinder task performance rather than help.  It is therefore crucial to deploy such agent-based planning solutions alongside human commanders in order to uncover the interactional issues that arise. Hence, in this paper, we develop algorithms and interaction mechanisms for humans and agents to collaborate in allocating tasks to first responders on the ground. In more detail, this work advances the state of the art in the following ways. First, we provide a novel representation of the emergency response planning problem that involves allocating teams of emergency responders to tasks in uncertain and dynamic environments. Second, using this representation, we develop an algorithm, using Multi-agent Markov Decision Processes, to solve the problem. We evaluate the algorithm and show that it outperforms standard benchmarks from the literature. Fourth,  we develop a mixed-reality location-based game, called AtomicOrchid that immerses participants  in a disaster response setting where they may send and receive instructions on mobile and computer-based interfaces. Fifth, we integrate our algorithm within a software agent that advises a human commander in the game to allocate tasks to the participants. Finally, we run a number of trials that show that  our algorithm  improves  performance  (compared to a no-agent setting) and  allow us to elucidate some of the key challenges faced when developing systems involving human-agent collaboration.
