	Abstract = {We present a field trial of how instructions
from an intelligent planning agent are dealt with by
distributed human teams, in a time-critical task setting
created through a mixed-reality game. We conduct
interaction analysis to examine video recorded field
observations and game log data. The findings highlight the
social process by which players interpret and negotiate the
agent guidance as well as how these are intertwined with
social dynamics of the teams. The insights can be used to
develop an understanding of interactional issues around
automated team instructions and inform the design of
human-centred planning support systems.},

The aim of the system is to facilitate benchmarking of coordination approaches in controlled settings for dynamic rescue scenario. In particular, the key features of the systems are: i) programming interfaces to plug-in coordination algorithms without the need for implementing and tuning low-level agents? behaviors, ii) implementations of state-of-the art coordination approaches: DSA and MaxSum, iii) a large scale crowd simulator, which exploits GPUs parallel architecture, to simulate the behaviour of thousands of agents in real time.},

@article{Khan-2011-JAAMAS,
	Abstract = {
      We consider a problem domain where coalitions of agents are formed
      in order to execute tasks. Each task is assigned at most one
      coalition of agents, and the coalition can be reorganized during
      execution. Executing a task means bringing it to one of the
      desired terminal states, which might take several time steps. The
      state of the task evolves even if no coalition is assigned to its
      execution and depends nondeterministically on the cumulative
      actions of the agents in the coalition. Furthermore, we assume
      that the reward obtained for executing a task evolves in time: the
      more the execution of the task is delayed, the lesser the reward.
      A representative example of this class of problems is the
      allocation of firefighters to fires in a disaster rescue
      environment. We describe a practical methodology through which a
      problem of this class can be encoded as a Markov Decision Process.
      Due to the three levels of factoring in the resulting MDP (the
      states, actions and rewards are composites of the original
      features of the problem) the resulting MDP can be directly solved
      only for small problem instances. We describe two methods for
      parallel decomposition of the MDP: the MDP RSUA approach for
      random sampling and uniform allocation and the MDP REUSE method
      which reuses the lower level MDP to allocate resources to the
      parallel subproblems.
      Through an experimental study which models the problem domain
      using the fire simulation components of the Robocup Rescue
      simulator, we show that both methods significantly outperform
      heuristic approaches and MDP REUSE provides an overall higher
      performance than MDP RSUA.

@article{Drury2009,
	Abstract = {Crowd behaviour in emergencies has previously been explained in terms of either 'mass panic' or strength of pre-existing social bonds. The present paper reports results from a study comparing high- versus low-identification emergency mass emergency survivors to test the interlinked claims (1) that shared identity in an emergency crowd enhances expressions of solidarity and reduces 'panic' behaviour and (2) that such a shared identity can arise from the shared experience of the emergency itself. Qualitative and descriptive quantitative analyses were carried out on interviews with 21 survivors of 11 emergencies. The analysis broadly supports these two claims. The study therefore points to the usefulness of a new approach to mass emergency behaviour, based on self-categorization theory (SCT).},
