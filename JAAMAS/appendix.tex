\noindent Before deploying our solution (as part of $PA$) to advise
human responders, it is important  to test its performance to
ensure it can return efficient solutions on simulations of the
real-world problem. Given there is no extant solution that
takes into account uncertainty in team coordination for emergency
response, we compare our algorithm with a greedy and a
myopic method to evaluate the benefits of coordination and
lookahead. For each method, we use our path planning algorithm to
compute the path for each responder. In the greedy method, the responders
are uncoordinated and select the closest tasks they can do. In
the myopic method, the responders are coordinated to select the
tasks but have no lookahead for the future tasks (Line 8 in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:taskplanning}). Table~\ref{tab:simulation} shows
the results for a problem with 17 tasks and 8 responders on a
50$\times$55 grid. As can be seen, our MMDP algorithm 
completes more tasks than the myopic and greedy methods (see Table
\ref{tab:simulation}). More importantly, our algorithm guarantees
the safety of the responders, while in the myopic method  only 25\%
of the responders survive and in the greedy method all responders
are killed by the radioactive cloud. More extensive evaluations are
beyond the scope of this paper as our focus here is on the use of
the algorithm in a field deployment to test how humans take up
advice computed by the planning agent $PA$.
