\section{The Disaster Scenario}

\noindent We consider a disaster scenario involving a satellite, containing radioactive fuel, that has crashed in a sub-urban area (see Section \ref{atomic} to see how this helps implement a credible mixed-reality game). While debris is strewn around a large area, damaging buildings and causing accidents and injuring civilians, radioactive discharge from the debris is gradually spreading over the area, threatening to contaminate food reserves and people. Hence, emergency services, voluntary organisations, and the military are deployed to help evacuate the casualties and resources before these are engulfed by  radioactive cloud.  In what follows, we model this scenario formally and then describe the optimisation problem faced by the actors (i.e., including emergency services, volunteers, medics, and soldiers) in trying to save as many lives and resources as they can.

\subsection{Formal Model}
\noindent Let $G$ denote a grid overlaid on top of the disaster space, and the satellite and actors are located at various coordinates $(x,y) \in G$ in this grid. The set of field responders be denoted as $i_1, \cdots, i_n \in I$ and the set of rescue tasks as  $t_1,\cdots, t_m\in T$.  As responders enact tasks, they may become tired or get injured. Hence, we assign each responder  a health level $h_i\in [0,100]$. Moreover, each responder will have  a specific role  $r \in Roles$ (e.g., fire brigade, soldier, or medic) and this will determine the capabilities he or she has and therefore the tasks he or she can perform. We denote as $Roles(i)$ the role of responder $i$. In turn, to complete a given task $t$,  a set of responders $I' \subseteq I$ with specific roles $R_t \subseteq R$ is required. Thus, a task can only be completed by a team of responders $I'$ if $\{Roles(i) | i \in I'\} = R_t$. 

Given this model, we next formulate the optimisation problem faced by the responders (and later solved in Section \ref{sec:algo}). To this end, we propose a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process (MMDP)~\cite{?} that captures the uncertainties of the radiative cloud and the responders' behaviours. Specifically, we model the spreading of the radiative cloud as a random process over the spatial space and allow the responders' actions to be failed or delayed during the rescue process. Other existing models for rescue tasks such as CFSTP~\cite{?} and HTSSC~\cite{?} cannot be applied to our problem as they usually require the process of task executions to be deterministic. They need to explicitly model the time limit of a task and the duration of completing a task by the responders as spatial and temporal constraints, which are stochastic in our domain. Instead, in the MMDP model, we represent the task executions as stochastic processes of state transitions. Thus, the uncertainties of the radiative cloud and the responders' behaviours can be straightforwardly captured with transition probabilities. Additionally, modeling the problem as a MMDP enables us to use many sophisticated algorithms that have already been developed in the literature.
