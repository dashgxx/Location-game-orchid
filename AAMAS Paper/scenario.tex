\section{The Disaster Scenario}

\noindent We consider a disaster scenario involving a satellite, powered radioactive fuel, that has crashed in a sub-urban area (see Section \ref{atomic} to see how this helps implement a  mixed-reality game). While debris is strewn around a large area, damaging buildings and causing accidents and injuring civilians, radioactive particles discharged in the air, from the debris, are gradually spreading over the area, threatening to contaminate food reserves and people. Hence, emergency services, voluntary organisations, and the military are deployed to help evacuate the casualties and resources before these are engulfed by  radioactive cloud.  In what follows, we model this scenario formally and then describe the optimisation problem faced by the actors  (i.e., including emergency services, volunteers, medics, and soldiers) in trying to save as many lives and resources as possible.  We then propose an algorithm to solve this optimisation problem (in Section \ref{sec:algo}. In Section \ref{sec:atomic}, we show how this algorithm can be used by a software agent (in our mixed-reality game) in a mixed-initiative process to coordinate field responders. 

\subsection{Formal Model}
\noindent Let $G$ denote a grid overlaid on top of the disaster space, and the satellite and actors are located at various coordinates $(x,y) \in G$ in this grid. The radioactive cloud induces a radioactivity level  $l \in [0,100]$ at every point it covers in the grid (100 corresponds to maximum radiation). While the exact radiation levels can be measured by responders on the ground (at every grid coordinate) using their geiger counter, it is assumed that some information is available  from existing sensors  in the area. However, this information is uncertain due to the poor positioning of the sensors and the variations in wind speed and direction (and we show how this uncertainty is captured in the next section). Let the set of field responders be denoted as $i_1, \cdots, i_n \in I$ and the set of rescue tasks as  $t_1,\cdots, t_m\in T$.  As responders enact tasks, they may become tired, get injured, or receive radiation doses that may, at worst, be life threatening. Hence, we assign each responder  a health level $h_i\in [0,100]$ that decreases based on their radiation dose and assume that their decision to perform the task allocated to them is liable to some uncertainty (e.g., they may not want to do a task because they are tired or don't believe it is the right one to do). Moreover, each responder will have  a specific role  $r \in Roles$ (e.g., fire brigade, soldier, or medic) and this will determine the capabilities he or she has and therefore the tasks he or she can perform. We denote as $Roles(i)$ the role of responder $i$. In turn, to complete a given task $t$,  a set of responders $I' \subseteq I$ with specific roles $R_t \subseteq R$ is required. Thus, a task can only be completed by a team of responders $I'$ if $\{Roles(i) | i \in I'\} = R_t$. 

Given this model, we next formulate the optimisation problem faced by the responders (and later solved by the planning agent in Section \ref{sec:algo}). To this end, we propose a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process (MMDP)~\cite{?} that captures the uncertainties of the radioactive cloud and the responders' behaviours. Specifically, we model the spreading of the radiative cloud as a random process over the disaster space and allow the actions requested from the responders to  fail (because they refuse to go to a  task) or incur delays (because they are too slow) during the rescue process. This stands in contrast to previous work \cite{csftp,HTSSC} that require the process of task executions to be deterministic and explicitly model the task deadlines as deterministic constraints (which are stochastic in our domain). Thus in the MMDP model, we represent  task executions as stochastic processes of state transitions. Thus, the uncertainties of the radioactive cloud and the responders' behaviours can be easily captured with transition probabilities. Additionally, modelling the problem as a MMDP enables us to use many sophisticated algorithms that have already been developed in the literature \cite{XX,YY,ZZ}.\textbf{Feng: which one do we use?}
