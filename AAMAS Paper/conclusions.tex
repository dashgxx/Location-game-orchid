\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
\noindent In this paper we presented a novel algorithm for team formation under uncertainty and a study of the deployment of such an algorithm within a planner agent working alongside human responders in a new mixed-reality game platform called AtomicOrchid. The results in simulation show that our algorithm outperforms the baseline greedy algorithm significantly both in terms of number of tasks completed and number of responders unharmed by radiation. Moreover, we demonstrated in our real-world deployment the effectiveness of the planning agent at improving human coordination and how it can be made to collaboratively, with humans, come up with new plans given real-world constraints. Moreover, based on our results, we provided new guidelines for the design of human-agent collectives. Future work will look at exploring different interactional arrangements of humans and agents, in particular where control may be distributed across the team.
