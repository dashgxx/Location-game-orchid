\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
\noindent In this paper we developed a novel approach to evaluate agent-based coordination algorithms to allocate teams of emergency responders in dynamic and uncertain environments.  In particular, we carried out field-trials of a task planning agent using mixed-reality game game called AtomicOrchid in order to focus on the issues that arise in human-agent collaborations in such settings. Results from the field trials indicate that  the planning agent generated effective plans and that the interaction mechanisms engineered for humans to collaborate with the agent allowed them to replay effectively according to their preferences and constraints. Crucially, the agent-assisted teams were shown to outperform the non-agent assisted team both in terms of the number of tasks completed and the number of responders unhurt by radiation.  Future work will look at running AtomicOrchid with expert responders and  exploring different interactional arrangements of humans and agents, in particular where control may be distributed across the team.
