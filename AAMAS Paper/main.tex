% AUTHORS


% For initial submission, do not give author names, but the
% tracking number, instead, as the review process is blind.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the

% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
The problem of allocating emergency responders to rescue tasks is a key application area for agent-based coordination algorithms. However, to date, none of the proposed approaches take into account the uncertainty predominant in disaster scenarios and, crucially, none have been deployed in the real-world in order to understand how humans perform when instructed by an agent. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, using Multi-agent Markov Decision Processes to coordinate emergency responders. More importantly, we deploy this algorithm in a mixed-reality game to help an agent guide human players to complete rescue tasks. In our field trials, our algorithm is shown to improve human performance and our results allow us to elucidate some of the key challenges faced when  deploying of mixed-initiative team formation algorithms. \end{abstract}

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Game scenario}
AtomicOrchid is a location-based mobile game based on the fictitious scenario of radioactive explosions creating expanding and moving radioactive clouds that pose a threat to responders on the ground (the field players), and the targets to be rescued around the game area. Field responders are assigned a specific role (e.g. `medic', `transporter', `soldier', `ambulance') and targets have specific role requirements, so that only certain teams of responders can pick up certain targets. For example, an `injured person' can only be picked up by an `ambulance' and a `medic' together. To pick up targets, the team must be collocated in the immediate proximity of the geofenced target. Furthermore, field responders must not expose themselves to radioactivity from the cloud for too long, else they risk becoming `incapacitated'.

In their mission to rescue all the targets from the radioactive zone, the field responders are supported by (at least one) person in a centrally located HQ room, and the planning agent that sends the next task to the team of field responders [assuming the agent will have been described in detail already].

\subsection{Player interfaces}
Field responders are equipped with a `mobile responder tool' providing sensing and awareness capabilities in three tabs (geiger counter, map, messaging and tasks; see figure XX). One tab shows a reading of radioactivity, player health level (based on exposure), and a GPS-enabled map of the game area to locate fellow responders, the targets to be rescued and the drop off zones for the targets. Another tab provides a broadcast messaging interface to communicate with fellow responders (field responders and HQ). Another tab shows the team and task allocation dynamically provided by the agent. Notifications are used to alert both to new messages and task allocations.

HQ is manned by at least one player who has at their disposal an `HQ dashboard' that provides an overview of the game area, including real-time information of the players' locations (see figure XX). The dashboard provides a broadcast messaging widget, and a player status widget so that the responders' exposure and health levels can be monitored. HQ can further monitor the   current team and task allocations by the agent. Importantly, only HQ has a view of the radioactive cloud, depicted as a heatmap. `Hotter' zones correspond with higher levels of radioactivity.

\subsection{Planning agent}
[Wenchao. Describe how the agent works (not implementation detail, add that in subsection below), i.e., when it is polled, what information is being exchanged, and how the team/task allocation is being constructed from that and sent.]
\input{radiation_model.tex}
\subsection{System architecture}
[Wenchao: adapt this to version 2.0] AtomicOrchid is based on the open-sourced geo-fencing game MapAttack\footnote{http://mapattack.org} that has been iteratively developed for a responsive, (relatively) scalable experience.  The location-based game is realized by client-server architecture, relying on real-time data streaming between client and server.

The client-server architecture is depicted in figure XX. Client-side requests for for less dynamic content use HTTP. Frequent events, such as location updates and radiation exposure, are streamed to clients to avoid the overhead of HTTP. In this way, field responders are kept informed in near real-time.

The planning agent agent ... [add implementation detail]

The platform is built using the geoloqi platform, Sinatra for Ruby, and state-of-the-art web technologies such as socket.io, node.js, redis and Synchrony for Sinatra, and the Google Maps API. Open source mobile client apps that are part native, part browser based exist for iPhone and Android; we adapted an Android app to build the mobile responder app.
